# Go Ghibli

**Note: This project is currently incomplete.**

**This is a school assignment project.**

## Overview

**Go Ghibli** is a school assignment designed to help you practice and integrate TypeScript with React while building a frontend application. The primary goal is to refresh your knowledge of React, gain hands-on experience with TypeScript, and create a visually appealing app that interacts with the Studio Ghibli API.

## Objectives

- **Review React**: Revisit React fundamentals and build a React-based frontend.
- **Practice TypeScript**: Apply TypeScript to variables, functions, and type aliases throughout the project.
- **AJAX Integration**: Fetch data asynchronously from the Studio Ghibli API.
- **Data Validation**: Use Joi to validate data received from the API.
- **CSS Styling**: Create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

1. **Fetch Film Data**:

   - Retrieve film data from the Studio Ghibli API.
   - Display information such as English title, description, at least one image, and director.

2. **TypeScript Integration**:

   - Use TypeScript for all variables, state management, and function definitions.
   - Define type aliases to describe the data structure from the API.

3. **Search Functionality**:

   - Implement a search feature that allows users to search for films by their English title.
   - The search should operate on the locally stored film data, not through additional API calls.

4. **Sorting and Display**:

   - Sort films by their release year, with the most recent films appearing first.
   - Ensure a clean and visually appealing display of film information.

5. **Favorites Feature**:
   - Allow users to "favorite" films.
   - Display a separate view for favorited films.
   - Provide functionality for users to reorder their favorite films.
   - Allow users to toggle a "watched" status for films in the favorites view.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**:

   - Clone the repository.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

2. **Run the Project**:

   - Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

3. **Validation**:

   - Joi is used to validate data. Ensure all API data conforms to the expected types and formats.

4. **Styling**:
   - Customize CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the application.

## Future Work

The project is still in progress. Upcoming tasks include implementing additional features, refining the user interface, and ensuring all functionalities are fully operational.
